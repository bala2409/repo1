exercise 1
1. Create a local repository. Insert some source code into it. Ensure that git will ignore all files with a suffix class, obj, dll, or exe; and also ignores the entire target directory.

2. Create at least 10 commits in the master branch, where there will be changes in at least three files in each commit.

3. Create a new branch "issue01", which will be based on the 5th commit in the master branch. At issue01, create 3 commities - in each commit there will be a change in at least 3 files.

4. Merge the changes from issue01 into the master.

5. At git.cs.vsb.cz, create a new ukm-school project in your namespace and upload your created git repository (upload master and issue001) - you can create the project at the beginning and download empty repositories.
At lms.vsb.cz upload an html file with a link to your repositories on git.cs.vsb.cz (use the link directly to this project in git.cs.vsb.cz - eg https://git.cs.vsb.cz/koz01/ukm)
